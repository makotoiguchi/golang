# Interfaces

## how is it defined?

```go
type Performer interface {
  Perform()
}
```

Any Struct that implements all methods defined by an Interface 
```go
type Musician struct {
  Name string
  Instrument string
}

func (p Musician) Perform() {
  fmt.Println("performing")
}
```

can be used when Interface type is required
```go
func PerformAtVenue(p Performer) {
  p.Perform()
}
```
